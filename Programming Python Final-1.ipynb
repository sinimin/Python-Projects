    "Welcome to Care4All PCPs, the largest Primary Care Network in the state of California! We are glad to have someone with your analytical prowess on board. We are interested in ensuring that our patients get the highest quality care at the fairest price. To that end, we hired a consultant to perform an analysis of hospitals in California to help us understand \n",
    "1) Which hospitals are the highest quality?\n",
    "2) Which hospitals charge the most/least?\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our request, the consultant provided data and code for each of those questions. While this was helpful, we want to rewrite the code in a different language and explain it in detail (no comments or explanations were provided). Then, we would like to extend this work to learn about the relationship between health quality and cost for our patients. Therefore, we have laid out 3 tasks. \n",
